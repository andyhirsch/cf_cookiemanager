Themes and Styling
===========================


The Cookie Manager includes a default Standalone theme, which features a clean and straightforward design that can be easily customized.
Additionally, there are several other themes provided with the Cookie Manager, serving as foundations for creating your own unique theme.

        #Default Theme Loaded by Extension by default
        includeCSS.cookieconsent = EXT:cf_cookiemanager/Resources/Public/Scss/default.css

        #Standalone Theme Overrides:

        #Clean Theme Example

        #Funky Light Theme Example
        #includeCSS.funkylight = EXT:cf_cookiemanager/Resources/Public/Scss/theme/funkylight.css

        #Darkmode Example
        #includeCSS.darkTheme = EXT:cf_cookiemanager/Resources/Public/Scss/theme/darkmode.css

        #Font Override Only

     }

Override Fluid Templates
-------------------------

We basically distinguish between **static templates** and **Fluid templates**. The static templates are used in the JavaScript context, you can find more about this in the `components-section<#components-static-templates>`_.

Current Fluid templates are:

1. The consent button on every page  **(cookiefrontend - List.html)** rendered automatically on every page

2. The cookie/services list **(cookielist - CookieList.html)** which you can use to show the cookies in GDPR-Pages as a content element.

We have provided a full UI kit as an example, where you can change the fluid templates and static components. You can use it as a reference for your own theme.

See a full implementation in our `example extension Coding-Freaks UI Kit <https://github.com/eibiflo/cf_cookiemanager_uikit/>`_

    # Override the template path for the cookie frontend Plugin (Consent-Management-Button on every page)
    plugin.tx_cfcookiemanager_cookiefrontend {
        view {
            templateRootPaths.1727778204 = EXT:cf_cookiemanager_uikit/Resources/Private/Templates/CFCookiemanager/
        }
    }

    # Override the template path for the cookie list Plugin (TT-Content Element)
    plugin.tx_cfcookiemanager_cookielist.view.templateRootPaths{
        1727778204 = EXT:cf_cookiemanager_uikit/Resources/Private/Templates/CFCookiemanager/
    }



Components (Static-Templates)
-------------------------

Frequently, simple CSS changes may not suffice to meet your requirements.
To address this, the Cookie Manager offers several HTML components that enable you to construct your own theme effectively.

You can locate these components in the following directory: EXT:cf_cookiemanager/Resources/Static/*.html.

* consentmodal.html
* settingsmodal.html
* settingsmodal_category.html


Understanding the IDs within the Javascript Context is crucial.
While you have the freedom to modify the CSS and HTML structure, it's vital to retain the same dom IDs. These IDs are utilized in the consent.js to identify the elements and establish the associated functionality.

Below is a basic example of the Consent Modal. Please note that the Text areas and Buttons are intentionally left empty, as the actual text content is dynamically added by the Javascript.

..  code-block:: html
    :caption: Example: EXT:cf_cookiemanager/Resources/Static/consentmodal.html

    <div id="cm" role="dialog" aria-modal="true" aria-hidden="false" aria-labelledby="c-ttl" aria-describedby="c-txt" style="visibility: hidden;">
        <div id="c-inr">
            <div id="c-inr-i">
                <div id="c-ttl" role="heading" aria-level="2"></div>
                <div id="c-txt"></div>
            </div>
            <div id="c-bns">
                <button type="button" id="c-p-bn" class="c-bn"></button>
                <button type="button" id="c-s-bn" class="c-bn c_link"></button>
                <button type="button" id="c-t-bn" class="c-bn c_settings"></button>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>


If you prefer to utilize your custom HTML structure, you must make adjustments to the Extension Configuration and specify the path to your HTML file.

To do this, follow these steps:

* Open the Settings Module.
* Navigate to "Configure Extensions."
* Search for "cf_cookiemanager" in the list of extensions.
* Choose the "Template-Tab."
* Set the path to your HTML file.
* EXT:your_sitepackage_or_extension/Resources/Static/consentmodal.html
* EXT:your_sitepackage_or_extension/Resources/Static/settingsmodal.html

By following these steps, you can integrate your own HTML structure into the Cookie Manager extension.
